  <h1>Learn the Facts</h1>
  <h4 class = "factsInfo">With so much circulating the web, it can be hard to differentiate the facts from opinions. It’s always a good idea to cross check the information you see, but when learning about something as important as climate change, we want to know who we get our information from. Below are facts from reliable sources.</h4>
