  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
  <h4 class = "aboutText">According to climate.nasa.gov the global temperature has risen 1.8 degrees celsius since the late 19th century, mainly due to carbon dioxide emissions caused by human activity. This shift in temperature continues to affect not only us, but other animals, biomes and organisms. We have already seen the amount of damage caused through the current state of the earth through melting glaciers, hotter temperatures, a rise in natural disasters, and a growing list of endangered and extinct species. If we don’t start becoming more eco-conscious now and changing our harmful habits, this damage will be permanent and we’ll suffer the consequences. <br><br> Our mission is to educate people about how their daily habits are harming the earth. While it’s not as easy to get big contributors (oil, fishing + other global companies) to change their ways, we can start by accessing our own faults. Small changes such as walking/biking to school instead of driving or thinking twice before contributing to fast fashion can make a huge difference over time. It’s time we take responsibility for the damage we have created as a species and start healing the place so many organisms call home. </h4>
